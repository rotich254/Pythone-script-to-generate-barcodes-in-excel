The script will read the Excel file, generate barcodes, and then create a new Excel file with two columns: one for the data and another for the barcode images. It assumes that the data for generating barcodes is in the first column of your input Excel file. The script uses the code128 library to generate the barcode images, which are then inserted next to the corresponding data in the Excel file.
